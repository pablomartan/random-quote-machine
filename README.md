# Random Quote Machine
## About
This is the first project for obtaining the freeCodeCamp [Front End
Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)
certification. It consists of building an app with a similar
functionality to [this one](https://random-quote-machine.freecodecamp.rocks/).

The libraries covered in the course were [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Usage
### Requirements
```
git
node
npm
```

To be able to run it in your computer you will have to clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/pablomartan/random-quote-generator
```

Once cloned, you'll have to access the directory through the terminal and run
this command to install the project's dependencies:
`npm i`. After that, you can run `npm start` and your browser should open a new
tab with the app. If it doesn't do so automatically, you can access the app
on `http://localhost:3000`.

You'll need access to the internet to be able to fetch the quote list.
